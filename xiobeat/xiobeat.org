** Dance gesture input system
*** Instead of navigating menus, you use short sequences of dance steps to trigger actions.
**** Could mean a learning curve, but dance game fans might be interested in
 that.
*** un-prefixed dance steps (:up :down :left :right) in sequence trigger song-specific actions
*** the phrases have a simple onscreen representation as an icon with a title
