* Features

** 10-button USB dance pad recommended (game console pad with compatible USB adapter)
** Numeric keypad can be used to try out the game and even freestyle with the fingers
** Backing tracks can be XM or 
** Dance gesture input system
*** Instead of navigating menus, you use short sequences of dance steps to trigger actions.
**** Could mean a learning curve, but dance game fans might be interested in
 that.
*** un-prefixed dance steps (:up :down :left :right) in sequence trigger song-specific actions
*** the phrases have a simple onscreen representation as an icon with a title
*** you don't have to memorize the phrases, but it helps 
*** corner buttons are command prefixes, each corner (:A :B :X :Y)
*** gestures look like (:A :right) meaning perhaps "trigger chord D minor"
*** another example: (:Y :Y) meaning quit?
*** (:X :down) --> XM pattern change to 2 (like numeric keypad)
*** (:X :A) --> XM pattern change to 9 (like numeric keypad)
** usb microphone for making noise
*** slight mic audio latency will not be a big problem
** usb camera for making freestyle videos
