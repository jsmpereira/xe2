This is the HELP screen for XIOBEAT. 

The EDIT screen is composed of 3 areas, from top to bottom: 

  - The split-screen spreadsheet view with 2 pages
  - A message output area
  - An interactive command prompt

Press Control-X to toggle the command prompt at the bottom of the
screen. The syntax is:
 
  command arg1 arg2 arg3 ...

Press ENTER while in the command prompt to execute the typed command.

For help on a command, type HELP :COMMAND at the prompt. 

In the spreadsheet area, two pages are shown side by side; the left
page, and the right page. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor in the
currently selected page.

The command Control-LEFT (LEFT-PAGE) selects the left page, and
Control-RIGHT (RIGHT-PAGE) selects the right page. Press TAB to invoke
SWITCH-PAGES, which selects the opposite page. (You can also type
these commands at the prompt and press RETURN to invoke the same
action; this is true in general for interactive commands in XIODEV.)

While in the spreadsheet view, use the ENTER command (ENTER key by
default) to enter data in the currently selected cell (in the current
page.) If the selected cell is blank, a new data cell is created.
Press Control-ENTER to save, or ESCAPE (the CANCEL command) to discard
changes.

To change the active tool, use SET-TOOL at the command line, or the
shortcut Control-T for NEXT-TOOL. Usable tools are CLONE (create a new
object).
